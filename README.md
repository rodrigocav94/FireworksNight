# FireworksNight
In this game app, users can create fireworks displays with just their fingers. Select rockets of the same color and hit the explode button or shake your device to watch them burst into brilliant fireworks. Exploding five fireworks at once earns 20 times more points than a single one. Be careful to avoid bombs, as touching them will cost a heart and bring you closer to game over.<br><br>
Technologies: SKAction.follow, UIBezierPath, for case let, colorBlendFactor, UIEvent, motionBegan.
